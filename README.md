# Digital-input-board-for-reactor-application
A detailed report on digital input board for reactor application. The project was done for Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic research as a final year project for my undergraduate thesis. The microcontroller used for the project is AT89C51 and supported by flip-flop, buffers, and latches. An impulse testing is provided at the output of the micrcontroller to perform impulse testing or unit testing which is a part of functional testing. Analog to digital converters are used in the design.

The application of the project is to figure out the accuracy and precision in the timing of the reactor valves based on the amount of steam generated active rods in the nuclear reactor. The amount of steam generated is directly proportional to the status of valves in the reactor system that is indicated by the LEDs on the digital input board.
